# CLASSIC PIPES

**For Fabric, NeoForge, and Forge**

Welcome to Classic Pipes! This is an item and fluid transport mod inspired by old versions of Buildcraft and Logistics Pipes, built from scratch to stylistically match up with modern Minecraft. As well as adding basic item and fluid transport pipes, Classic Pipes also introduces a system of networked pipes that can be hooked up to your chests and machines to sort, fetch, and craft items automatically.
